# One-to-one messaging

Evaluate the overhead of pub/sub in terms of throughput.

    - live capture/replay
    - raw tcp writes
    - two worker on different nodes?

Variables:

    Experiment (3): pub/sub, capture/replay, raw tcp
    Message Size: 1 byte to ??

We only have one consumer and one producer thread, as capture/replay only supports this.

# One-to-many messaging

- compare throughput per channel for
    2,3,4...10000 subscriber

- vs aggregated throughput


-> problem to measure latency i need a synchrnoized clock
